# Result
We've already created a simple system which allows us to mine every 3 transactions sent from a independent transactor  into a block, 
then broadcast it to all miners. We could also send or ask for a blockchain from the other miners. The blockchain is saved into a file `JSON` in local disc of the miner.
Blocks and transactions are always verified before mining or adding to blockchain in order to avoid the fraud.
Beside, we also created a user interface to make it easy to test.<br/>

Comparing to out initial objectives, we are satisfied with what we did though there are still some features which could and should be improved. 
Besides, we also have many ideas to develop and improve this system in the future. 

# Project Management
In general, we finished our objectives before deadline. However, the schedule was not well orgarnized.

## Development Practices
### Documentation
**[Good]** All documents and sequence diagrammes are written in Markdown!
### Git
**[Good]** Commit and push often. <br/>
**[Bad]** Provide commit messages
### Code
**[Good]** Clean and well formalized codes. <br/>
**[Bad]** Not many comment codes. <br/>
