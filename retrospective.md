## Difficulties & Improvement
 Despite the succes we get, we still have a lots of problem to solve.
- In our protocol, we accept to add a new mined block right away to the blockchain, then broadcast it to all other miners.
Therefore, there is a  conflict when many miners success to mine a new block simultaneously.
To solve this kind of problem, we suggest to increase the difficulty of mining or change the strategy of mining and verification.
- To create a valid transaction, we used private key of sender to encode the transaction's content 
to a signature. To check its validation, we just need to unblock the signature by the sender's public key. 
However, we also can combine private key of sender and public key of receiver to encode the message, that will make the transaction more security.
- About team scheduling, we think we didn't arrange it well enough. We should arrange more meetings within the group and work more with our meta-group. Due to the lack of connection with meta-group we didn't use the same protocol for both groups. As a result, we couldn't do the testing with them but within our team members only.

## Retrospective
Project Walkthrough
We were a team of three due to the fourth member quit since the very beginning of this semester. We started in a very good ambiance to discuss and worked closely and collaboratively on the project protocol. We had several meetings and discussions which went quite well during the launching of project and during the lab session. 
Later on, project went on smoothly while we met and discussed fewer than before, the ambiance and morality became a bit neutral. 
Though our working style, working tempo and rhythm as well as personal characters differ one another, still, we try to respect these differences, kept updated and working over github until closing to the ending point. 

Lessons learned
-  Have a nice and happy kick start, keep good ambiance and high morality and motivation from the beginning to the end. We started happy, while later become a bit neutral
-  Meet and discuss regularly and frequently from the very beginning until the very end.
-  Communicate, collaborate, divide and explain each one's work part and  propose possible advice or ideas in case of any difficulty, keep doing this during the whole working process.  We made this in the early stage, and did not do so well later. 
-  Keep track of project's agenda and advancement while taking into account each member's working tempo, habits, personal characters and background...
-  Team Esprit is the King. We can have more practices and team work experience to improve...
